# System Level Bonus project
  
[find out more info here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vdkikl6o3d6wqvu/Bonus%20Project.pdf?dl=0)  

We're doing topic 4: Mini Library
  
There are 7 functions that we need to implement - pick what you want to work on, tell the group in slack, and then use the helper functions defined at the top of the file to implement it.

Consult the document at the link above when you have a part to work on for exactly what you need to do. Hopefully each part is general enough to have no one step on each other's toes  
  
Heads up: final is on May 1st at 4:15pm-6:15pm  
  
We need to get this done by April 28th so we can present to the teacher on the 29th or May 1st.
