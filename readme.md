We're doing topic 4: Mini Library

Here are all the parts that need to be worked on:
- a function for basic file access/allocation/deacllocation
- functions that search the file for a row or rows value
- functions to make additions or deletions to a file
- functions to made edits to a file
- functions that accept input and responds to it (this one basically ties all the other ones together)

Consult the document at the link above when you have a part to work on for exactly what you need to do. Hopefully each part is general enough to have no one step on each other's toes
